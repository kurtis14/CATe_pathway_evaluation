The following section headers starting with “METRIC” indicate relevant metrics. Patient demographics are summarized across encounters based on initial parent encounter.\nNote: Tables and figures are initial drafts and can be modified as needed later."

However, we also see that some encounter types were repeated (i.e., the loops), likely indicating where patients could not be initially reached by one provider then were passed to a different provider within the same type.\nNote: This figure includes all available encounters in MOIS, including “parent” and potentially no-response encounters.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Flow of Patients by Encounter Type"
